# Contributing

## Guidelines
* Adding a new function can be done by copying TEMPLATE.md, renaming it, and editing it as needed.
* You may provide edits of existing functions, just edit and submit it.
* When possible, organise files in their respective category folders.
* When writing the function signature, please make sure it is **valid typed Luau syntax**. Documentation for typed luau can be found [here](https://luau-lang.org/typecheck#union-types).
* When referencing arguments of a function in the description, please use `` in order to make `it look nice like so`.
* Please confirm a function has not already been added to the API before you submit it.

* Functions must be named appropriately, if you are contributing one - the following criteria applies for the naming:
  * No brand names should be visible in your documentation.
    * This also includes function alias' - UNC aims to be a vanilla naming convention, not a branded one
   * The function name must be **descriptive of what the function does**.
   * Aliases for shortening function names without good reason are *not* allowed. For example, `hookfunc` is not a alias supported by UNC. Function names should be written out in full.
  
* The description must be coherent, if the function is basic enough to not warrant one - you may put "N/A" in the description.
* Functions don't always require an alias, you may just also put N/A in that field.

* For automated testing purposes, all code examples within code blocks should be able to run independently and verify during runtime that the host executor runs it successfully. 

## Submitting your edits and/or additions
This can be done through [github pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests). Clone the repository, make your changes, then submit a pull request. The pull request will be reviewed by several members of the UNC before it is merged.
